/// Link Key Notification Event
///
/// The Link Key Notification event is used to indicate to the Host that a new Link Key has been created for the connection with the device specified in BD_ADDR. The Host can save this new Link Key in its own storage for future use. Also, the Host can decided to store the Link Key in the BR/EDR Control- ler’s Link Key Storage by using the Write_Stored_Link_Key command. The Key_Type event parameter informs the Host about which key type (combina- tion key, local unit key, or remote unit key, debug combination key, unauthenti- cated combination key, authenticated combination key or changed combination key) that was used during pairing. If pairing with unit key is not supported, the Host can for instance discard the key or disconnect the link.
///
/// The combination key Key_Type is used when standard pairing was used. The debug combination key Key_Type is used when Simple Pairing was used and the debug public key is sent or received. The unauthenticated combination key Key_Type is used when the Just Works Simple Pairing association model was used. The authenticated combination key Key_Type is used when Simple Pair- ing was used and the Just Works association mode was not used. The changed combination key Key_Type is used when the link key has been changed using the Change Connection Link Key procedure and Simple Pairing Mode is set to enabled. Note: It is the responsibility of the Host to remember the Key_Type (combination, debug combination, unauthenticated combination, or authenticated combination) prior to changing the link key.
