/// Disconnection Complete Event
///
/// The Disconnection Complete event occurs when a connection is terminated. The status parameter indicates if the disconnection was successful or not. The reason parameter indicates the reason for the disconnection if the disconnection was successful. If the disconnection was not successful, the value of the reason parameter can be ignored by the Host. For example, this can be the case if the Host has issued the Disconnect command and there was a parameter error, or the command was not presently allowed, or a Connection_Handle that didn’t correspond to a connection was given.
///
/// - Note: When a physical link fails, one Disconnection Complete event will be returned for each logical channel on the physical link with the corresponding Connection_Handle as a parameter.
