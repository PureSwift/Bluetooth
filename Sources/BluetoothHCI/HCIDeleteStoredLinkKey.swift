The BR/EDR Controller can store a limited number of link keys for other BR/EDR devices. Link keys are shared between two BR/EDR devices and are used for all security transac- tions between the two devices. The Delete_All_Flag parameter is used to indicate if all of the stored Link Keys should be deleted. If the Delete_All_Flag indicates that all Link Keys are to be deleted, then the BD_ADDR command parameter must be ignored This command provides the ability to negate all security agreements between two devices. The BD_ADDR command parameter is used to identify which link key to delete. If a link key is currently in use for a connection, then the link key will be deleted when all of the connections are disconnected.
