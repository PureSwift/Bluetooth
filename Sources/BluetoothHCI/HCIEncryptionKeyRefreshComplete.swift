/// Encryption Key Refresh Complete Event
///
/// The Encryption Key Refresh Complete event is used to indicate to the Host that the encryption key was
/// refreshed on the given Connection_Handle any time encryption is paused and then resumed.
/// The BR/EDR Controller shall send this event when the encryption key has been refreshed
/// due to encryption being started or resumed.
///
/// If the Encryption Key Refresh Complete event was generated due to an encryption pause
/// and resume operation embedded within a change connection link key procedure, t
/// he Encryption Key Refresh Complete event shall be sent prior to the Change Connection Link Key Complete event.
///
/// If the Encryption Key Refresh Complete event was generated due to an encryption pause and
/// resume operation embedded within a role switch procedure,
/// the Encryption Key Refresh Complete event shall be sent prior to the Role Change event.
