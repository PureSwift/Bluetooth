/// The Connection Complete event indicates to both of the Hosts forming the connection that a new connection has been established. This event also indicates to the Host, which issued the Create_Connection, or Accept_Connection_ Request or Reject_Connection_Request command and then received a Command Status event, if the issued command failed or was successful.
