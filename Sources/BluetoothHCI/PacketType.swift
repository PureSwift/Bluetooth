/// The packets used on the piconet are related to the logical transports they are used in. Three logical transports with distinct packet types are defined (see Section 4 on page 97): the SCO logical transport, the eSCO logical transport, and the ACL logical transport. For each of these logical transports, 15 different packet types can be defined.
///
/// To indicate the different packets on a logical transport, the 4-bit TYPE code is used. The packet types are divided into four segments. The first segment is reserved for control packets. All control packets occupy a single time slot. The sec- ond segment is reserved for packets occupying a single time slot. The third seg- ment is reserved for packets occupying three time slots. The fourth segment is reserved for packets occupying five time slots. The slot occupancy is reflected in the segmentation and can directly be derived from the type code. Table 6.2 on page 118 summarizes the packets defined for the SCO, eSCO, and ACL logical transport types.
///
/// All packet types with a payload shall use GFSK modulation unless specified otherwise in the following sections.
///
/// ACL logical transports Enhanced Data Rate packet types are explicitly selected via LMP using the packet_type_table (ptt) parameter. eSCO Enhanced Data Rate packet types are selected when the eSCO logical transport is established.
