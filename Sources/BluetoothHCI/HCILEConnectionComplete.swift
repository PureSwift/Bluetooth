/// LE Connection Complete Event
///
/// The LE Connection Complete event indicates to both of the Hosts forming the connection
/// that a new connection has been created. Upon the creation of the connection a
/// `Connection_Handle` shall be assigned by the Controller, and passed to the Host in this event.
/// If the connection establishment fails this event shall be provided to the Host that had issued
/// the LE Create Connection command.
///
/// This event indicates to the Host which issued a LE Create Connection command
/// and received a Command Status event if the connection establishment failed or was successful.
///
/// The `masterClockAccuracy` parameter is only valid for a slave.
/// On a master, this parameter shall be set to 0x00.
