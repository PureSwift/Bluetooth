// MARK: - Command

/// Inquiry Command
///
/// This command causes the BR/EDR Controller to enter Inquiry Mode. Inquiry Mode is used to discover other nearby BR/EDR Controllers. The LAP input parameter contains the LAP from which the inquiry access code shall be derived when the inquiry procedure is made. The Inquiry_Length parameter specifies the total duration of the Inquiry Mode and, when this time expires, Inquiry will be halted. The Num_Responses parameter specifies the number of responses that can be received before the Inquiry is halted. The event parame- ters of Inquiry Complete event will have a summary of the result from the Inquiry process, which reports the number of nearby BR/EDR Controllers that responded.

/// A device which responds during an inquiry or inquiry period should always be reported to the Host in an Inquiry Result event if the device has not been reported earlier during the current inquiry or inquiry period and the device has not been filtered out using the command Set_Event_Filter. If the device has been reported earlier during the current inquiry or inquiry period, it may or may not be reported depending on the implementation (depending on if earlier results have been saved in the BR/EDR Controller and in that case how many responses that have been saved). It is recommended that the BR/EDR Con- troller tries to report a particular device only once during an inquiry or inquiry period.
