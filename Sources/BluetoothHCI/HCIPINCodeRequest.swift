/// The PIN Code Request event is used to indicate that a PIN code is required to create a new link key. The Host shall respond using either the PIN_Code_Request_Reply or the PIN_Code_Request_Negative_Reply command, depending on whether the Host can provide the Controller with a PIN code or not.
///
/// - Note: If the PIN Code Request event is masked away, then the BR/EDR Controller will assume that the Host has no PIN Code.
/// When the BR/EDR Controller generates a PIN Code Request event in order for the local Link Manager to respond to the request from the remote Link Manager (as a result of a Create_Connection or Authentication_Requested com- mand from the remote Host), the local Host must respond with either a PIN_Code_Request_Reply or PIN_Code_Request_Negative_Reply com- mand before the remote Link Manager detects LMP response timeout
