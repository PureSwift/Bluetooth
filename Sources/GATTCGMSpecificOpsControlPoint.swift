 CGM Specific Ops Control Point
 
 The CGM Specific Ops Control Point encapsulates all functionality and mechanisms that are unique to a CGM-device.
 This control point is used with a service to provide CGM specific functionality and the ability to change CGM specific settings of the device.
 This includes functions like setting the CGM Communication Interval or the sending a calibration value to the device.
 The criterion in the Operand field is defined by the service that references this characteristic
 
 [CGM Specific Ops Control Point](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/viewer?attributeXmlFile=org.bluetooth.characteristic.cgm_specific_ops_control_point.xml)
 
 - Note:
 
     1. C1: Mandatory if device supports E2E-CRC (Bit 12 is set in CGM Feature) otherwise excluded
 
     2. Describes the Operand which is used for setting and getting the calibration value
 
     3.The fields in the above table are in the order of LSO to MSO. Where LSO = Least Significant Octet and MSO = Most Significant Octet
