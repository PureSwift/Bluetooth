 Apple iBeacon
 
 iBeacon is an exciting technology enabling new location awareness possibilities for apps. Leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a device with iBeacon technology can be used to establish a region around an object. This allows an iOS device to determine when it has entered or left the region, along with an estimation of proximity to a beacon . There are both hardware and software components to consider when using iBeacon technology, and this document will give an introduction to both, along with suggested uses and best practices to help ensure a highly effective deployment leading to an outstanding user experience.
 
 Devices with iBeacon technology can be powered using coin cell batteries for a month or longer, or operate for months at a time using larger batteries, or can be powered externally for extended periods of time. iOS devices can also be configured to generate iBeacon advertisements, although this functionality is limited in scope. This would be appropriate for uses such as a Point Of Sale or kiosk application, or for an application that wants to become an iBeacon for a short time while someone is actively using the application.
